This is a very, very simple CRUD app(but it works!!).  There is an author and a tile imput field.  One can get all of the documents in the mongo database by clicking the 'show all books' button.  One can submit by clicking the submit button.  Once one can see all of the documents then they will see a edit and delete next to each record.  

Finally, all of the books listed when you first access the database are quite good. I recommend them.
