This is a very, very simple CRUD app.  There is an author and a tile imput field.  One can get all of the documents in the mongo database by clicking the 'show all books' button.  One can submit by clicking the submit button.  Once one can see all of the documents then they will see a edit and delete next to each record.  

I left my .env file in my git. I am not sure why you would need it but it is there if you do.  It doesn't have a personal password so I am not worried about it.

Finally, all of the books listed when you first access the database are quite good. I recommend them.# Library-App
