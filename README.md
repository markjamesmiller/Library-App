This is a very, very simple CRUD app(but it works!!).  There is an author and a tile imput field.  One can get all of the documents in the mongo database by clicking the 'show all books' button.  One can submit by clicking the submit button.  Once one can see all of the documents then they will see a edit and delete next to each record.  

To run the app:
Run the src/server.js file in node. You will need to change the port to a local port on your machine so that you can navigate to that localhost port in your browser.  Also, you should run npm install after cloning the file to make sure you have all the necessary dependencies.

Finally, all of the books listed when you first access the database are quite good. I recommend them.
